                <h3 >SYNOPSIS</h3>

                <p>When Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Bruce Banner (Hulk) try to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go terribly wrong, leading to the creation of Ultron, a powerful and sentient artificial intelligence. Programmed to protect humanity but misinterpreting his purpose, Ultron determines that the only way to save the Earth is to eradicate humanity.

                    The Avengers—Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye—must reunite to stop Ultron’s catastrophic plans. Along the way, they encounter the Maximoff twins: Pietro (Quicksilver), who has superhuman speed, and Wanda (Scarlet Witch), who has telekinetic and mind-manipulating powers. Initially aligned with Ultron, the twins later switch sides upon learning his true intentions.
                    
                    The movie is packed with epic battles, witty banter, and emotional moments as the team faces internal conflicts, learns the price of heroism, and works to prevent Ultron from launching his ultimate weapon: a plan to cause global extinction.
                    
                    Key themes include artificial intelligence, teamwork, and the moral implications of creating technologies to control peace.</p>

                <h3 >REVIEW</h3>
                <p>Avengers: Age of Ultron is an action-packed sequel that expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe with epic battles, character development, and humor. While the film delivers impressive visuals and introduces new characters like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, it falls short due to an underwhelming villain, uneven pacing, and a plot that feels overstuffed with storylines. Despite these flaws, it's an essential film that sets up future MCU events and provides entertaining moments for fans.
