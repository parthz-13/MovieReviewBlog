                <p>
                    Death Note is a gripping psychological thriller that follows Light Yagami, a brilliant yet disillusioned high school student who discovers a mysterious notebook called the Death Note. The notebook grants him the power to kill anyone whose name he writes in it, as long as he knows their face. Determined to create a utopia free of crime, Light takes on the persona of "Kira" and begins eliminating criminals. However, his actions attract the attention of L, an enigmatic and equally brilliant detective tasked with stopping him. What ensues is an intense game of cat and mouse, filled with strategic battles, moral dilemmas, and a descent into the dark depths of human ambition and justice.
