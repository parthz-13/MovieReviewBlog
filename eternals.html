                <p>
                    Eternals follows a group of immortal beings sent by celestial entities to Earth thousands of years ago to protect humanity from monstrous creatures known as Deviants. After centuries of living in secrecy, the Eternals must reunite when the Deviants re-emerge and a catastrophic event known as the "Emergence" threatens Earth. As they confront their past and make difficult choices about their future, they grapple with their purpose and their deep ties to humanity.

                <h3 >REVIEW</h3>
                <p>Eternals is an ambitious and visually striking Marvel film that explores profound themes of love, loss, and responsibility. While its slower pace and complex narrative differ from typical MCU movies, the film offers a refreshing take on the superhero genre, supported by a diverse and talented cast. With Chloé Zhao’s unique direction, it delivers a more introspective and emotional experience, though its vast scope can feel uneven at times.
