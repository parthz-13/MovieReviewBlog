                <p>Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, Train to Busan is a gripping South Korean action-horror film that redefines the zombie genre. The story follows Seok-woo, a workaholic fund manager, who boards a train from Seoul to Busan with his estranged daughter, Su-an, to reunite her with her mother. As a zombie outbreak ravages South Korea, the passengers on the train must fight for survival against hordes of the undead. The journey becomes a high-stakes battle for survival and humanity, as alliances form, sacrifices are made, and the thin line between selfishness and heroism is tested.</p>

                <h3 >REVIEW</h3>
                <p>Train to Busan combines relentless action with heartfelt emotion, delivering a zombie thriller that transcends the genre. Yeon Sang-ho’s direction is taut and dynamic, maintaining an intense pace while allowing moments of quiet reflection on human connections and morality.
                    <br><br>
                    The film excels in its character-driven narrative, with Gong Yoo giving a standout performance as Seok-woo, whose personal growth anchors the story. Kim Su-an shines as Su-an, delivering a touching portrayal of innocence amidst chaos. Ma Dong-seok steals the show with his commanding yet endearing presence as Sang-hwa, blending humor, strength, and vulnerability.
                    <br><br>
                    The confined train setting amplifies the tension, with claustrophobic sequences and innovative use of the environment making the action scenes unforgettable. The makeup and effects for the zombies are top-notch, creating genuinely terrifying adversaries. Beyond the horror and thrills, the film explores themes of sacrifice, redemption, and societal critique, leaving a lasting emotional impact.
