                <h3 >SYNOPSIS</h3>

                <p>
                    The Dark Knight (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a gritty and thrilling superhero film that redefined the genre. A sequel to Batman Begins (2005), it follows Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) as he confronts chaos unleashed by a new criminal mastermind, the Joker (Heath Ledger).

                    As Gotham City struggles to recover from rampant crime, Batman, along with police lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), seeks to dismantle organized crime. The Joker, however, disrupts their plans with his anarchic philosophy, aiming to prove that even the most virtuous people can be corrupted under the right circumstances.
                    
                    The film delves into themes of morality, sacrifice, and the thin line between heroism and villainy, culminating in Harvey Dent’s tragic transformation into the vengeful Two-Face. Batman ultimately takes responsibility for Dent's actions, becoming a fugitive to preserve Gotham's hope.
