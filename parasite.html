                <h3 >SYNOPSIS</h3>

                <p>Directed by Bong Joon-ho, Parasite is a gripping South Korean black comedy thriller that delves into class disparity and social hierarchies. The film follows the impoverished Kim family, who cunningly infiltrate the affluent Park household by posing as unrelated and highly qualified individuals. What begins as a comedic con quickly spirals into a tense and tragic exploration of greed, privilege, and human desperation. Beneath its genre-blurring narrative lies a searing critique of economic inequality, exposing the vulnerabilities and flaws of both the wealthy and the struggling classes.</p>

                <h3 >REVIEW</h3>
                <p>Parasite is a masterclass in storytelling, blending humor, suspense, and tragedy into a cohesive narrative that is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. Bong Joon-ho’s direction is meticulous, using every frame to amplify the film’s themes of inequality and moral ambiguity. The performances are universally excellent, with Song Kang-ho delivering a standout portrayal of a desperate yet resourceful father.
                 <br>   <br>
                    The film’s screenplay is layered and sharp, offering a rollercoaster of emotions that keeps audiences on edge. The production design, particularly the contrast between the cramped semi-basement apartment of the Kims and the modernist luxury home of the Parks, is a visual metaphor for the stark divide between social classes.
                    <br> <br>
                    The tonal shifts—from lighthearted comedy to heart-pounding tension—are seamless, making the climactic moments even more shocking and impactful. The film’s twisty plot and thought-provoking ending leave a lasting impression, encouraging viewers to reflect on societal structures and human nature.
