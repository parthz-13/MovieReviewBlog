Shang-Chi, having left his father's shadow and started a new life in San Francisco, is forced to confront his past when his father seeks him out to fulfill an ancient destiny.

                    When Wenwu learns of a mystical realm called Ta Lo, where legendary creatures and ancient powers reside, he sets out to conquer it, believing it holds the key to bringing back his deceased wife, which could lead to catastrophic consequences for the world. Shang-Chi, joined by his best friend Katy and his estranged sister Xialing, must find a way to stop his father and prevent the unleashed power of the Ten Rings from destroying everything they hold dear. Along the way, Shang-Chi learns more about his heritage, his potential, and what it truly means to be a hero.
