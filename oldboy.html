                <h3 >REVIEW</h3>
                <p>Oldboy is a visceral, unrelenting exploration of vengeance, trauma, and human depravity. Park Chan-wook’s direction is both poetic and brutal, crafting a film that is as visually striking as it is emotionally jarring. The fight sequences, particularly the iconic one-take hallway fight scene, are masterfully choreographed and have become emblematic of the film’s raw, gritty aesthetic.
                    <br><br>
                    Choi Min-sik’s performance as Oh Dae-su is extraordinary, capturing a wide range of emotions—from despair and rage to vulnerability—anchoring the film with a deeply human core. Yoo Ji-tae as the enigmatic antagonist delivers a chilling and complex portrayal, elevating the stakes of the narrative with his calculated malevolence.
                    <br><br>
                    The film’s twist, which reveals the horrifying truth behind Dae-su’s imprisonment, is both shocking and deeply affecting, pushing the boundaries of psychological storytelling. The haunting score and meticulous production design heighten the tension and underscore the film’s themes of memory, identity, and retribution.
