                <h3 >SYNOPSIS</h3>

                <p>After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War, the universe is in ruins following the efforts of Thanos, who wiped out half of all life. The remaining Avengers and their allies are left reeling from the loss of their loved ones and struggling to move on. When Scott Lang (Ant-Man) escapes the quantum realm and proposes a bold plan to undo the Snap, the heroes regroup. With the help of Bruce Banner (now Professor Hulk), Tony Stark (Iron Man), and others, they embark on a daring mission through time. Their goal is to retrieve the Infinity Stones from various points in history, reverse Thanos' actions, and restore everything to how it was. However, their journey isn't without peril. A past version of Thanos discovers their plan and wages a climactic battle against the Avengers, leading to incredible sacrifices and heroic moments. In a final showdown, Iron Man uses the Infinity Stones to defeat Thanos and his army but loses his life in the process. The film concludes with a mix of hope and sorrow: the world begins to rebuild, Thor appoints Valkyrie as ruler of New Asgard, Steve Rogers (Captain America) chooses to return to the past to live the life he always wanted, and the Avengers disband, their legacy secured. Avengers: Endgame is a story of loss, resilience, and ultimate triumph, marking the end of an era in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
